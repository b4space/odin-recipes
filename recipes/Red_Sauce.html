            4 cloves garlic, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            pinch of red pepper flakes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon (2 g) dried oregano
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons (50 g) tomato paste
        </li>
        <li>
            2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 large sprig basil
        </li>
        <li>
            Kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Steps
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a large pot, combine oil and garlic, and heat over moderately low heat until garlic begins to very gently sizzle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until garlic just begins to turn a light golden color, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add oregano and continue to cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until paste has softened and blended with oil, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in canned tomatoes and their juices, increase heat to medium-high, bring to a gentle simmer, then lower heat to maintain.
        </li>       
         <li>
            Using an immersion blender, blend tomatoes until sauce is smooth.
            (Alternatively, use potato masher to crush tomatoes or crush tomatoes by hand before adding to pot.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Add basil and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced slightly and tastes rich, about 30 minutes. 
            Season with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discard basil. Stir in butter, if using, until melted. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Use sauce right away, or allow to cool to room temperature, transfer to sealed containers and refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 6 months.
        </li>
    </ol>
